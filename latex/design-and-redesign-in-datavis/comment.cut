Following our own precepts, we've tried to make this essay
part of a larger conversation. The impetus came from an online critique by Alberto Cairo,
along with discussion that followed on Twitter, blogs, and email. In particular we'd like
to thank Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willen Tulp, and others for helpful discussions and
pointers.
